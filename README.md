Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-This project was designed to produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased, produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day, or produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased. This allows users to easily determine what inventory items are being bought on what days and in what quantity, allowing them to more intelligently stock their store in anticipation of data proven trends.

What did you do particularly well?
-I believe that I did a fair job of integrating Python and C++, as it was my first real professional attempt at it. I can honestly say that I learned something new thanks to that aspect of the project.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-I think that the best way to enhance my code would be to add improved user functionality, such as a way for users to see if a given day consistently had higher orders of a certain item. I also think being able to implement a time stamp based look up system would allow users to better determine when there is the highest demand for an object and better prepare for busy periods.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-The hardest part of this code was figuring out just how to integrate Python and C++. I knew I was over-complicating it, but it took watching quite a few youtube videos and reading a few stackoverflow threads for me to completely understand just how straightforward the process was. I also asked a co-worker with significant C++ experience to coach me - definitely a huge help and a powerful addition to my support network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-As I'm sure I've mentioned before, learning how to properly integrate C++ and Python is a major bonus to my toolbox and something that will easily transfer to other projects that would benefit from being multilingual. However, the simpler aspects of this project (Such as looking up the recurrence of an item as well as what days it was purchased on) are mainstays that many programs will greatly benefit from (Both on the user end and internally).

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-In my opinion, the reason that the project is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is because of how I took the time to properly organize and format my code. Paying extra attention to my whitespace and just the general organization of my functions really paid dividends. I also think the proper use of comments will greatly help anyone that is trying to use my code and/or edit it.
